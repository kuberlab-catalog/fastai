# Practical Deep Learning for Coders, Part 1

This project contains lessons material for Part 1 of the data science course Practical Deep Learning for Coders.

https://course.fast.ai



Lessons are using fastai library, which simplifies training fast and accurate neural nets using modern best practices.

See the [fastai website](https://docs.fast.ai) to get started. The library is based on research
into deep learning best practices undertaken at [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai), and includes
\"out of the box\" support for [`vision`](https://docs.fast.ai/vision.html#vision),
[`text`](https://docs.fast.ai/text.html#text), [`tabular`](https://docs.fast.ai/tabular.html#tabular),
and [`collab`](https://docs.fast.ai/collab.html#collab) (collaborative filtering) models. For
brief examples, see the [examples](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/tree/master/examples) folder;
detailed examples are provided in the full [documentation](https://docs.fast.ai/).
